                                    <p><span class="image right"><img src="images/teaching.jpg" alt="" /></span> As a graduate student, I had several opportunities to cover lectures for a variety of classes and I even had the opportunity to teach my own summer class. I also covered lectures as a postdoc, and now as a professor, I am the instructor of record for two classes per semester.</p>

                                    <h4>Scientific Writing for the REU and Beyond</h4>
                                    <p>This course was a professional development class offered to the Research Experience for Undergraduate (REU) students at the University of Notre Dame. As part of their REU project, students are required to produce a written report. This class teaches students, who may have no prior experience with writing scientific papers, how to effectively communicate their research to a broad physics community. Goals of the class include for students to learn how to plan out their paper, develop strategies for drafting, and learn what makes an effective figure or table. The goals of the class are achieved through a mixture of lecture, group discussion, peer review, and office hour discussions. Syllabus and sample class materials available upon request.</p>

                                    <h4>Lectures Covered</h4>
                                    <p>The Physics Teaching Practicum gives physics graduate students at the University of Notre Dame the opportunity to get actual lecture experience, which is not included in regular teaching assistant duties. Students are allowed to cover up to three lectures per semester under observation from a professor in the department or someone from the Kaneb Center for Teaching Excellence. After three lectures covered, students create a teaching portfolio that includes class preparation materials, self-reflections for each lecture, and observer feedback. The portfolio also includes student feedback if available. I completed the Teaching Practicum twice as a graduate student and my portfolios can be available upon request.</p>

                                    <p>In addition to covering lectures through the Teaching Practicum, I have also covered a few lectures for astronomy classes at Iowa State University. These lectures were not done under observation and class preparation materials were provided to me.</p>
